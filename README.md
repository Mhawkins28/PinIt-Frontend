<h1 align="center">PinIt</h1>

  <p align="center">
  PinIt is a social app where users can see a map consisting of people’s favorite places. These places are pins that users can select and add to their profile. Pins are categorized by cities, so users will have profile pages that list their pins.

## User stories

### MVP

- As the user, I want to have a well-designed, clean interface that is easy to understand and navigate.
- As the user, I want multiple pages to see and/or organize the data that is entered. (CRUD routes)
- As the user, I want to to be able to add pins of specified locations.
- As the user, I want the pins I create to be categorized by cities.
- As the user, I want to be able to see my pins on the map.
- As the user, I want to see other pins that people have posted.
- As the user, I want to be able to sign in and create a new account (Token Authorization)
- As the user, I want to to have a profile page that has a list of my pins.

### Stretch Goals
- As a user, when adding a new pin, I would like the search bar to auto-populate the location name.
- As a user, I would like to add comments on other people’s pins.
- As a user, I want my password to be encrypted (bcrypt).
- As a user, I would like to have suggestions based on current pins.
- As a user, I would like to be able to add images to my pins.

### Future Features 

- OAuth with Google, Twitter, Facebook, and GitHUB
- User profiles should have a list view of the their pins with drop downs of different cities and their pins.
- Google Maps Search bar doesn't load on first load. User should refresh but will lose the coordinates if clicked on specific spot on map.
- Users should be able to upload more than just 1 photo.
- Profile map page and global map page should have distinctions between them.
- Users should not be able to sign up with a username that is already taken.
- Pins should have a different icon depending on if its the users or someone else’s.
- When redirecting back to the home map after editing pin, the info window with the old information is still populated.
- Users should be able to add their hometown and let the map center to that location on their profile.
- Users should be able to see what photo they uploaded. (Configure Cloudinary)
- Users should be able to view other people's profiles and pins.
